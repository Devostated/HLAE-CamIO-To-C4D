== INSTALLATION ==

To install - simply copy the folder 'hlaecamio2c4d' to the Cinema4D Plugins folder, usually located at:
    C:\Program Files\MAXON\CINEMA 4D <version>\plugins

== USAGE ==

Open the plugin under the plugins menu, select the CamIO file and click import.
If the plugin was recorded with fovScaling at none (version 1 CamIO files only), you will be required to specify
the recording resolution (the plugin will automatically set your project settings to this as well).

If you want to import the camera to line up with csgo maps exported to c4d use "Import for map usage". (for certain workflows)

To map a coordinate received from the game via getpos or mirv_input position, use the following mappings:

			Without Import for map usage
				X -> Z
				Y -> -X			(1, 3, 5) maps to (-3, 5, 1)
				Z -> Y

			With Import for map usage
				X -> X
				Y -> Y			(1, 3, 5) maps to (1, 3, -5)
				Z -> -Z
